# Problem 1

This problem uses the Instacart data. DO NOT include this dataset in
your local data directory; instead, load the data from the
p8105.datasets using:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illustrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

``` r
head(instacart)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 15

    ## # ℹ 8 more variables: order_dow <int>, order_hour_of_day <int>,
    ## #   days_since_prior_order <int>, product_name <chr>, aisle_id <int>,
    ## #   department_id <int>, aisle <chr>, department <chr>

- How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
  from?

``` r
# How many number of aisles are there?
num_aisles = length(unique(pull(instacart, aisle)))
num_aisles
```

    ## [1] 134

``` r
# Which aisles are the most items ordered from?
aisle_orders = instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarise(order_count = n()) |>
  arrange(-order_count)

head(aisle_orders)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 2
    ##   aisle                         order_count
    ##   <chr>                               <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables                   150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits                       150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits          78493
    ## 4 yogurt                              55240
    ## 5 packaged cheese                     41699
    ## 6 water seltzer sparkling water       36617

`Fresh vegetables` are the most items ordered from.

- Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
  limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
  aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
# filtering aisles with more than 10000 items ordered
filtered_aisles = instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarise(order_count = n()) |>
  filter(order_count > 10000) |>
  arrange(order_count)

# plotting
ggplot(filtered_aisles, aes(x = reorder(aisle, order_count), y = order_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() + # to make it horizontal for better readability
  labs(title = "Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle",
       x = "Aisle",
       y = "Number of Items Ordered") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```

- Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
  aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
  fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
  table.

- Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
  Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
  format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

# Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010") 
```

``` r
brfss_df = brfss_smart2010 |>
  janitor::clean_names()
```

This problem uses the BRFSS data. DO NOT include this dataset in your
local data directory; instead, load the data from the p8105.datasets
package.

First, do some data cleaning:

- format the data to use appropriate variable names;
- focus on the “Overall Health” topic
- include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
- organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
  “Excellent”

Using this dataset, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

- In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
  in 2010?
- Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
  contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
  across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
  average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a
  line for each state across years – the geom_line geometry and group
  aesthetic will help).
- Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
  distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
  locations in NY State.

        2 ~ "High school equivalent",
        3 ~ "More than high school")) |>

Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to self-report
techniques for studying physical activity in observational studies and
clinical trials, largely because of their relative objectivity. During
observation periods, the devices can measure MIMS in a short period;
one-minute intervals are common. Because accelerometers can be worn
comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce around-the-clock
observations.

This problem uses accelerometer data collected on 250 participants in
the NHANES study. The participants’ demographic data can be downloaded
here, and their accelerometer data can be downloaded here. Variables
\*MIMS are the MIMS values for each minute of a 24-hour day starting at
midnight.

Load, tidy, merge, and otherwise organize the data sets. Your final
dataset should include all originally observed variables; exclude
participants less than 21 years of age, and those with missing
demographic data; and encode data with reasonable variable classes
(i.e. not numeric, and using factors with the ordering of tables and
plots in mind).

Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each
education category, and create a visualization of the age distributions
for men and women in each education category. Comment on these items.

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to
create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these total
activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men
to women and have separate panels for each education level. Include a
trend line or a smooth to illustrate differences. Comment on your plot.

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph;
including smooth trends may help identify differences.
