# Problem 1

Load the datasets.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illustrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

``` r
head(instacart)
```

- How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
  from?

``` r
# How many number of aisles are there?
num_aisles = length(unique(pull(instacart, aisle)))
num_aisles
```

    ## [1] 134

``` r
# Which aisles are the most items ordered from?

  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarise(order_count = n()) |>
  arrange(-order_count)

head(aisle_orders)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 2
    ##   aisle                         order_count
    ##   <chr>                               <int>

    ## 5 packaged cheese                     41699
    ## 6 water seltzer sparkling water       36617

`Fresh vegetables` are the most items ordered from.

- Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
  limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
  aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r

instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarise(order_count = n()) |>
  filter(order_count > 10000) |>
  arrange(order_count) |>

# plotting
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, order_count), y = order_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() + # to make it horizontal for better readability
  labs(title = "Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle",
       x = "Aisle",
       y = "Number of Items Ordered",
       caption = "Data from the instacart package") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

![](p8105_hw3_xz3173_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

- Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
  aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
  fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
  table.

``` r

aisles_of_interest = c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")

- Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
  Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
  format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r

The `instacart` dataset has 1384617 observations and 15 variables. There
are 134 aisles are there, and `fresh vegetables` aisles are the most
items ordered from.

# Problem 2

Import data

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010") 
```

First, do some data cleaning:

``` r
brfss_smart2010 = brfss_smart2010 |> 
  
  # format the data to use appropriate variable names
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  
  # focus on the “Overall Health” topic
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") |>
  
  # include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Poor")) |>
  
  # organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”
  mutate(response = factor(response, 
                           levels = c("Poor", "Excellent"),
                           ordered = TRUE))
```

- In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
  in 2010?

``` r
brfss_smart2010 |>
  group_by(year, locationabbr) |>
  summarise(n_locations = n_distinct(locationdesc)) |>
  filter((year == 2002 | year == 2010) & n_locations >= 7)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

- Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
  contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
  across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
  average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a
  line for each state across years – the geom_line geometry and group
  aesthetic will help).

``` r
excellent_df = brfss_smart2010 |>
  filter(response == "Excellent") |>
  group_by(year, locationabbr) |>
  summarise(average_value = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
ggplot(excellent_df, aes(x = year, y = average_value, group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line() +

       x = "Year", 
       y = "Average Value",
       caption = "Data from the brfss_smart2010 package") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

- Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
  distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
  locations in NY State.

``` r
ny_df = brfss_smart2010 |>
  filter(locationabbr == "NY" & (year == 2006 | year == 2010))

Comment on these items.

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day.

Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to create a total
activity variable for each participant. Plot these total activities
(y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men to women and
have separate panels for each education level. Include a trend line or a
smooth to illustrate differences.

``` r
activity_df = merged_df |>
  group_by(seqn, sex, age, education) |>
  summarise(total_activity = sum(min1:min1440, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'seqn', 'sex', 'age'. You can override
    ## using the `.groups` argument.

Comment on your plot.

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex.

``` r
inspection_activity = merged_df |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("min"),
    names_to = "Minute",
    names_prefix = "min",
    values_to = "Activity") |>

Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this
