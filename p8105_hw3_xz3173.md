The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illustrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

``` r

`Fresh vegetables` are the most items ordered from.

- Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
  limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
  aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

```

<img src="p8105_hw3_xz3173_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />

- Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
  aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
  fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
  table.

``` r

- Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
  Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
  format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

The `instacart` dataset has 1384617 observations and 15 variables. There
are 134 aisles are there, and `fresh vegetables` aisles are the most
items ordered from.

# Problem 2

Import data

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010") 
```

First, do some data cleaning:

``` r
brfss_smart2010 = brfss_smart2010 |> 
  
  # format the data to use appropriate variable names
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  
  # focus on the “Overall Health” topic
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") |>
  
  # include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) |>
  
  # organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”
  mutate(response = factor(response, 
                           levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"),
                           ordered = TRUE))
```

- In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
  in 2010?

``` r
states_with_7_or_more_locations_in_2002 = brfss_smart2010 |>
  filter(year == 2002) |>
  group_by(year, locationabbr) |>

    ## 14  2010 WA                    10

**CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, PA are the states were observed at 7 or more
locations in 2002. CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX,
WA are the states with 7 or more locations in 2010. In 2002, there are 6
states had observations from 7 or more locations, which indicates the
health assessments was more concentrated in these states in 2002.
Comparing with that, there are 14 states had observations from 7 or more
locations, which indicates the health assessment had a expansion in
coverage region. CT is the only one state that list in 2002, butt not on
2010. This might cause by various reasons, such as funding loss or
reduce, possible data collection loss or reduce, health priorities/focus
transfer to other areas.**

- Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
  contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
  across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
  average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a
  line for each state across years – the geom_line geometry and group
  aesthetic will help).

``` r
excellent_df = brfss_smart2010 |>
  filter(response == "Excellent") |>
  group_by(year, locationabbr) |>
  summarize(average_value = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
print(excellent_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 443 × 3

    ## # ℹ 433 more rows

``` r
ggplot(excellent_df, aes(x = year, y = average_value, group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Average Value Over Time for 'Excellent' Response", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Average Value",
       caption = "Data from the brfss_smart2010 package") +

**The spaghetti plot displays the trend of “Excellent” health responses
over the years for each state. (Since there is so many states, the
legend is hid in the plot.) States with increasing trends show improving
perceptions of health, while decreasing trends might indicate worsening
perceptions. From the plot, we could see most states have volatile
pattern with increasing and decreasing trends during 2002 to 2010. This
indicates that variable factors influencing these perceptions, as well
as differ from each states. The various factors might be different
social determinants of health, such as economic, social, or
environmental. For example, the improvements in access to healthcare
services might shows the increasing trends. Unemployment might be one of
the factor that impact the decreasing tends.**

- Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
  distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
  locations in NY State.

``` r
ny_df = brfss_smart2010 |>
  filter(locationabbr == "NY"  & (year == 2006 | year == 2010)) 

ggplot(ny_df, aes(x = response, y = data_value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(. ~ year) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Data Value in NY for 2006 and 2010", 
       x = "Response", 
       y = "Data Value",
       caption = "Data from the brfss_smart2010 package")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_xz3173_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="90%" />

**The two-panel plot shows the spread and median of the data values for
different health responses in NY state for the years 2006 and 2010.
Comparing the distributions of responses across two different years
within the same state, we could see there are some improvement in health
perceptions for “Poor”, “Fair”, “Good” response from 2006 to 2010, where
the central line within each box has improved, which represents the
median, the middle value of the data. From the interquartile range (the
main body of the box plot), we could see there was a greater variability
in perceptions with “Poor”, “Fair”, “Very good” responses, where the
boxes are wider.**

**Comments: There are more males than females have education of level of
high school equivalent. Both males and females have more people with
education level of more than high school. The age distribution among
high school equivalent and less than high school is approximately same.
The age distribution for more than high school is tends to lean on lower
ages.**

Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to create a total
activity variable for each participant. Plot these total activities
(y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men to women and
have separate panels for each education level. Include a trend line or a
smooth to illustrate differences.

``` r
activity_df = merged_df |>
  group_by(seqn, sex, age, education) |>
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'seqn', 'sex', 'age'. You can override
    ## using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
ggplot(activity_df, aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(. ~ education) +
  labs(title = "Total Activity vs. Age by Education Level",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Total Activity",
       caption = "Data from the nhanes_covar and nhanes_accel datasets") 
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

**Comments: From the plot, we can see the spread of the points mostly
stay in the bottom of the plot, which means most of people have lower
activity. From the slopes of the trend lines, we could see the negative
slopes, which indicates the negative relationship between the two
variables of age and total activities, when the age goes up, the total
activities goes down, and vice versa. From the plot of high school
equivalent and less than high school, we can see males tend to have
higher activity. For the more than high school plot, female has a
slightly higher trend line than male, which indicates female has a
little higher total activity than male. There are also some anomalies
points in the plots, which means there are a few people don’t follow the
trend line and have higher activity.**

Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for
each education level and use color to indicate sex.

``` r
inspection_activity = merged_df 

ggplot(inspection_activity, aes(x = minute, y = activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = seqn), alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(. ~ education) +
  labs(title = "24-hour Activity Time Course by Education Level",
       x = "Time of Day",
       y = "Activity",
       color = "Sex",
       caption = "Data from the nhanes_covar and nhanes_accel datasets") 
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_xz3173_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="90%" />

Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this
graph; including smooth trends may help identify differences.

**The faint lines are closely clustered, which indicates that many
people have similar activity patterns. Except for the plot of more than
high school, there are some lines are scattered, which indicates that
some people have different activity patterns. The color represent sex,
which indicates males and females mostly have similar trends of activity
around the day. Except for more than high school, females tend to might
be more active during the middle of the day. The smoothed line gives an
average trend across everyone. The peaks in those trend suggest that
most people have active times during 500 min to 1000 min in the 24-hour,
while troughs suggest more sedentary periods. Since the x-axis
represents time, activity during late night hours (time0-time250) are
likely due to sleeping, peak could be associated with typical working
hours, meal times, or exercise periods (time500-time1000+).**
